<h3>Josee The Tiger and the Fish</h3>
<p>A coming of age movie which teaches about realizing your dreams and overcoming obstacles.A beautiful film to say the least. </p>
<h3>Dead Poet's Society</h3>
<p>The human race is one filled with passion,curiosity and love for everything around.The fact that we have emotions sets us apart from
    robots and AI and tells us there is more to life than just blindly acheieving goals and leading unfulfilled lives.
</p>
<h3>Nimona</h3>
<p>A recent movie I watched which was hilarious and utterly heartfelt and heartwarming.Makes us question who really are the antagonists
    in our lives.
